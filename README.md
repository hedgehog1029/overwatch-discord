# Installation

I'll get you a JAR at some point. Maybe. In the meantime, grab JDA2 and build it into the same jar.
Make a file called login.json in the same directory as the jar. Put the following in the file:

`{"token": "<TOKEN>"}`

Fill in the relavant fields. Run the jar. You should be all set!
