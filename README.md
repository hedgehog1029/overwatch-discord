# overwatch-discord
A Discord bot, written in Java.

# Installation

I'll get you a JAR at some point. Maybe. In the meantime, grab jDiscord and build it into the same jar.
Make a file called login.json in the same directory as the jar. Put the following in the file:

`{"email": "<DISCORD USER EMAIL>", "password": "<PASSWORD>"}`

Fill in the relavant fields. Run the jar. You should be all set!
